# Inertia Update

This mod updates the LOOSE LOOT (items on the ground) and STATIC CONTAINERS (locations/spawn rates of jackets, boxes, etc. but NOT THEIR CONTENTS) to match live values.
The odds of STATIC LOOT (what spawns INSIDE of static containers) is not updated because 3.9.0 changes these to use per-map intead of global values, and a larger rewrite would be needed to support it in this mod.

**These changes will be included in SPT 3.9.0, at which point this mod will be obsolete. Please delete it when that time comes.**

There is no comprehensive changelog for loot changes, but loot inside marked rooms (including the Rusted Bloody Key room featured in "The Room" quest) should be noticeably better than 3.8.X SPT.
