# Loot Update

This mod updates the LOOSE LOOT (items on the ground) and STATIC CONTAINERS (locations/spawn rates of jackets, boxes, etc. but NOT THEIR CONTENTS) to match live values. The odds of STATIC LOOT (what spawns INSIDE of static containers) are not updated because 3.9.0 changes these to use per-map instead of global values, and a larger rewrite would be needed to support it in this mod.

This mod does NOT add any new items. It only updates the loot distributions of existing items.

## To install, just use 7-zip to drop the user folder into your SPT installation folder.

There is no comprehensive changelog for loot changes, but loot inside marked rooms (including the Rusted Bloody Key room featured in "The Room" quest) should be noticeably better than 3.8.X SPT.

The files included in this release are from 3 June 2024, so if any loot changes happened in more recent updates they will not be represented.
