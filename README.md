# Loot Update

This mod updates the LOOSE LOOT (items on the ground) and STATIC CONTAINERS (locations/spawn rates of jackets, boxes, etc.) and STATIC LOOT (what spawns INSIDE of static containers) to match live values.

This mod does NOT add any new items. It only updates the loot distributions of existing items.

## To install, just use 7-zip to drop the `user` folder into your SPT installation folder.

## Compatibility
### This mod should load before any other mod that touches loot. The folder has "aaa" at the start so that should happen naturally. If you manually manage your load order, make sure it's at the top.

Static loot mods may or may not work depending on how they're implemented. If there's a conflict, you can either disable static loot handling in the config for this mod, or don't use the other mod.

Loose loot mods loaded after this **should** work, but I offer no guarantees. Please do not ask me about compatibility.

## There is no comprehensive changelog for loot changes. 
One example of a notable change is that the loot inside marked rooms (including the Rusted Bloody Key room) should be noticeably better than 3.8.X SPT. Yes, marked rooms spawn keycards.

The files included in this release are from 12 June 2024, so if any loot changes happened in more recent updates they will not be represented.
